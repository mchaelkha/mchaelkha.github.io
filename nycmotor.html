        <h2>Data Mining Final Project</h2>
        <p>
          I have always had an appreciation for working with data. During my last semester I decided to challenge myself and take a data mining course while skipping the prerequisite AI class.
          You can <a href="https://github.com/mchaelkha/nyc-collision-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">access the repository here</a> (don't mind the data science coding quality!).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The high-level project prompt is below.</p>
        <section id="instructions">
          Given the NY City car crash data base. Imagine that NY City has hired you to assess the impact of COVID-19 on
          their traffic flow. Identify any new hazards.
          Determine the impact of COVID-19 on crashes in NY City in the year 2020.
          In particular, explore, find data, and create data visualizations of:
          <ol>
            <li>For the years before 2020, which boroughs had the most accidents?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Did this distribution change during 2020?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              For the years before 2020, which months had the most accidents? Students in the past have said they thought
              there were 10% fewer accidents in February then in January. Is this true or is this bogus?
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Did this distribution change during 2020?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>For the years before 2020, which types of accidents were most prevalent?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Did this distribution change during 2020?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>For the years before 2020, which days of the week had the most accidents?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Did this distribution change during 2020?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>For a typical year before 2020, how given a seven day calendar that starts at 12:01 AM on Saturday and goes
          until 11:59 PM midnight on Sunday, when are accidents most likely to happen? </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Which day of the week is most likely to have an accident?</li>
              <li> What time of the day is most likely to have an accident?</li>
              <li>Does this change in 2020?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Does the timing of when accidents happen depend on the borough of NY City?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Does the amount of change vary from year to year?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              For the years before 2020, given the entire region of NY City, which regions are ‚Äúhot spots,‚Äù or places where
              accidents are most likely to occur?
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You will need to do some Parzen density estimation on this. You will need
                to use the GPS coordinates. You may need to convert the GPS coordinates from degrees:minutes:seconds, to
                degrees.fractions of degrees (fractional degrees). You do not need to use the Haversine distance. Assume that
                longitude and latitude is Euclidean for NY City.
              </li>
              <li>Create a ‚Äúheat map‚Äù of where accidents occur and overlay it on a map of the city.</li>
              <li>Do the hot spot locations change in 2020?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Compare the number of car-only accidents (car and car or car and obstacle) with car-pedestrian accidents (car
              and person or car and bicycle). Do these proportions change in 2020?</li>
            <li>While working on the data, did you discover anything else you wanted to explore?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Some students in the past found relationships between weather and numbers of accidents.
                One team identified the surge in the number of accidents that happened after the change to/from daylight
                savings time.
              </li>
