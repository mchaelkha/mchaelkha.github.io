# Personal Website
This is the repository of my [personal website](https://khacoding.com). I am
using GitHub pages to share work that I have done.

## Current Status
I plan to do a re-haul on the site in the summer. The original website
was written before I took a class on web and mobile development. I would like
to incorporate elements of web design and use JavaScript to better enhance the
user experience.

## Projects
I plan on hosting webpages that I create on this site. There will also be a
page describing projects I have worked on in classes and on the side in the
near future.
