            <p>Names provide substance to software. The variables you use, the
                functions you call, and the files you write all have names. It
                is important to be <i>good</i> at naming. The other day, my
                brother, who was working on image processing research, realized
                that he was misusing the correlation coefficient function from
                the <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy
                library</a> for months. He wanted the coefficient of
                <i>determination</i> to perform linear regressions on some
                datasets.
            </p>
            <h2 id="how">How?</h2>
            <p>Generally you want to name using whole words. No symbols. Just
                words. Names can be phrases that fully express your ideas. The
                best way to demonstrate is with an example. The following are
                possible variable names for a list of people's ages in an area.
            </p>
            <ul id="code">
                <li>List&lt;Integer&gt; aList;</li>
                <li>List&lt;Integer&gt; theAgeOfPeopleInUrbanAreas;</li>
                <li>List&lt;Integer&gt; populationAge;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most readable is 'populationAge'. There is a clear
                indication what population age means here. The list contains
                the age of a population. There is also a lack of articles and
                specifics. We want to describe the bare minimum without adding
                distractions and limitations to what might be in a list.
                When it comes to naming, there is a clear way of describing
                intention and interpretation.
            </p>
            <h2 id="intent">Intent</h2>
            <p>There are several benefits to good naming. The main ones are
                being able to understand and change the code later on. You want
                to save time when reading code. It is frustrating to read
                poorly written code and trying to get inside the head of
                another developer. Good names are meant to answer questions a
                reader may have. Consider revising names that require
                explanatory comments.
            </p>
            <p>We should also avoid acronyms. Acronyms leave the reader guessing
                the meaning of symbols. This is especially true when it comes to
                writing code in a dynamically typed language. The reader has to
                decipher how the name is being used out of context.
            </p>
            <h2 id="interpret">Interpreting</h2>
            <p>Similar names can create misassociations of information. Perhaps
                you have multiple observers that observe different subjects.
                Naming them o1, o2, and o3 would be a disaster. You want to be
                able to interpret how each variable interacts within a function
                easily.
            </p>
            <p>Having a generic name can also lead to trouble. Often enough,
                you may want to search for a specific variable you named. If
                the variable was named 'a', you would bring up every instance
                where you typed the letter 'a'. You want to make a name
                specific enough while at the same time being unique. Another
                lesson from this is when you use a name, stick with it. Make it
                searchable.
            </p>
            <h2 id="conventions">Conventions</h2>
            <p>Typically, classes and objects should have nouns or noun
                phrases. Methods should be actions or verbs.
            </p>
            <p>Another rule to follow is sticking to a single word per
                concept. If classes both act as controllers, it is best to call
                them controllers. When you start to call classes differently,
                you consequently introduce discrepancies between those classes.
                What makes a controller different from a manager?
            </p>
            <p>Names should originate from the problem domain. Using the common
                language of the domain is essential for having the programmer
                be on the same page as the expert.
