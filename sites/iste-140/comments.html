                “The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to
                express ourself in code. Note that I used the word failure. I
                meant it. Comments are always failures.” <p>Robert C.

            <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
            <p>The purpose of using comments is to explain code that is unable
                to express itself. We may also write comments to detail in plain
                English what we are doing. Code should always try to be
                self-explanatory. Even when we write comments, the code is the
                one speaking. Comments only indicate what you the programmer
                intended the code to do.
            </p>
            <p>Comments should not replace bad code. Bad code needs to be fixed.
                First consider revising the code before adding in-line comments.
                The reality is that the person will look at the code for a
                number of reasons, the main ones being to understand, reuse, or
                make changes. The code is always universal.
            </p>
            <h2 id="good">Good Comments</h2>
            <p>Sometimes comments are necessary. It may be a coding standard
                that is expected of the programmer. There is a reason comments
                can be collapsed. A main usage of comments is header blocks.
                Header blocks should concisely tell the reader what each class
                and what each function does. The variables used and the
                expected inputs and outputs are detailed.
            </p>
            <p>Comments seek to clarify and may validate the reader's
                understanding. Comments may show consequences to using a
                function poorly, where that function should never be called at
                an instance of time. They can also address less obvious calls
                to other functions.
            </p>
            <h2 id="bad">Bad Comments</h2>
            <p>There are many times where you should not leave comments around.
                Comments may become redundant for simple functions that are
                clear. As mentioned, comments can also be misleading to what the
                code actually does. Another case of bad comments is commented-
                out code. It is a subcategory of lava flow and faces the same
                problems of why was this code not deleted.
            </p>
            <p>I have been through many classes in the computer science and
                software engineering curriculum that mandate all classes,
                functions, and fields need comment blocks. Sometimes by having
                self-explaining names, the need for comments is pointless. They
                add additional "noise" as Martin points out. I have fallen to
                be a victim where I copy-paste documentation of the same field
                in various classes out of following convention.
